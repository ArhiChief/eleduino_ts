# By default, usbhid capture device before eleduino_ts, and eleduino_ts will 
# not work. To prevent this scenario we need

# 1. Unbind our device from usbhid:
ATTRS{idVendor}=="0eef", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0005", DRIVER=="usbhid", RUN="/bin/sh -c 'echo -n $kernel > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usbhid/unbind'"

# 2. Bind device to eleduino_ts driver:
ATTRS{idVENDOR}=="0eef", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0005", RUN="/bin/sh -c 'echo -n '0eef 0005' > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/eleduino_ts/new_id'"

# 3. Change access to new event device, created by eleduino_ts to grant access 
# for it for to another programs:
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0eef", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0005", MODE="0660"
